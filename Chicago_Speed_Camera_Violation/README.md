The notebook provides some exploratory data analysis of the City of Chicago Speed Camera Violations from the Chicago Data portal.
Website (including documentation):https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4

This dataset reflects the daily volume of violations that have occurred in Children's Safety Zones for each camera. The data reflects violations that occurred from July 1, 2014 until May 29,2919. The reported violations are those that have been collected by the camera and radar system and reviewed by two separate City contractors. In some instances, due to the inability the registered owner of the offending vehicle, the violation may not be issued as a citation. However, this dataset contains all violations regardless of whether a citation was issued, which provides an accurate view into the Automated Speed Enforcement Program violations taking place in Children's Safety Zones. More information on the Safety Zone Program can be found here: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/children_s_safetyzoneporgramautomaticspeedenforcement.html.


The goal of the project is to analyze data from hundreds of speed violation cameras placed in Children Safety Zones throughout Chicago. It would be difficult to identify hotspots and determine how to incentivize drivers to change behavior to increase child safety without data analysis.

**Conclusions:**
- Most citations occur on weekdays (specifically Tuesdays), and significantly less on the weekends.
- Active cameras have increase over the data collection period
- The most violations happen in Ward 23, special information/education programs could be targeted there.
