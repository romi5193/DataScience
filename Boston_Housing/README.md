Boston Housing dataset provides several features of over 500 homes in Boston. The goal is to build a model to predict home prices.


**Conclusions:**
- The factors that seem to contribute most to a home's value are: the number of rooms, the percentage of lower status of the population,  proportion of non-retail business acres per town and pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- The accuracy of the model is 69%
