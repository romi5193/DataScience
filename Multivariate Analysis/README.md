### Multivariate Analysis of Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy data

Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) is a critical tool for chemical analysis of materials. The EELS spectrum is a plot of the energy loss vs. intensity. *EELS Spectrum Image 1.dm3* is a 3 dimensional dataset (the area scanned in x and y with an EELS spectra acquired at each pixel).

- *EELS Spectrum Image 1.dm3* is an example dataset
- *EELSspecanalysis.py* is the analysis of this data
- Results consist of:
  - *factors.png* (deconvoluted spectra with each component identified)
  - *loadings.png* (maps of each component)
