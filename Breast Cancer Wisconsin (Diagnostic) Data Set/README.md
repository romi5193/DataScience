The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset includes several parameters about breast cancer tumors. The goal is to build a model to classify unlabeled tumors as malignant or benign.


**Conclusions:**
- The factors that seem to best predict malignancy or benign tumors are: mean radius, mean perimeter, mean area, mean concavity, mean concave points, worst radius, worst perimeter, worst area, worst and concave points.
- The accuracy of the model is 96%
